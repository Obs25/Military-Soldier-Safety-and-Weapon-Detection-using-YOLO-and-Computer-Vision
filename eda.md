## 🔢 Class Distribution (Train Set)

- **Balanced?**: Moderately imbalanced
- **Underrepresented Class**: `trench`

| Class ID | Class Name         | Note       |
|----------|---------------------|------------|
| 0        | camouflage_soldier  | ✅          |
| 1        | weapon              | 🔥 Common   |
| 2        | military_tank       | ✅✅        |
| 3        | military_truck      | ✅✅        |
| 4        | military_vehicle    | ✅✅        |
| 5        | civilian            | ✅✅✅      |
| 6        | soldier             | 🔥🔥🔥🔥    |
| 7        | civilian_vehicle    | ✅✅        |
| 8        | trench              | ⚠️ Rare     |

## 📐 Bounding Box Size Distribution

- **Most common size:** Medium to small
- **Small objects** (< 20px width or height): ~10%

| Metric         | Width (px) | Height (px) |
|----------------|------------|-------------|
| Mean           | ~45        | ~60         |
| Min            | 1          | 1           |
| Max            | ~600       | ~620        |

---

## 🟥 Small Object Challenge

| Class Name     | Small Object Count |
|----------------|--------------------|
| weapon         | High               |
| soldier        | Moderate           |
| trench         | Low but present    |

---

## 🧮 Objects per Image

- Typical range: **0–20** boxes per image
- Most common: **3–5 objects per image**

---

## 📊 Class Co-occurrence Insights

- High correlation between:
  - `soldier` ↔ `weapon`
  - `soldier` ↔ `military_vehicle`
  - `civilian` ↔ `civilian_vehicle`

---

## 📏 Bounding Box Aspect Ratio

- Mostly between **1.0 to 1.5** (square-like)
- No major anchor box optimization needed

---

## 🔥 Heatmap of Object Locations

- Objects are **mostly centered** in images
- `soldiers` and `weapons` form dense clusters in center field

---

## 🖼️ Sample Image Validation

- Random samples were visualized
- Bounding boxes match objects and classes correctly
- Labels appear accurate overall

---

## ⚠️ Annotation Quality Check

- Initially found **15 invalid annotations** with 0 width/height
- Cleaned via auto-script
- ✅ Post-cleaning: **0 zero-size boxes remaining**

---

## 🧪 Image Quality Assessment

- Laplacian blur test on 200 random samples
- Found ~5–10 blurry images
- Blurred samples kept for robustness (simulate real-world fog/low-light)

---

## 🧾 Insights & Recommendations

1. ✅ Dataset is **ready for YOLOv8 training**
2. ⚠️ Apply **data augmentation** for underrepresented classes (`trench`, `weapon`)
3. ✅ Address class imbalance using **class weights or oversampling**
4. ✅ Use automated annotation checks in future updates

---

## 📦 Next Steps

- Train YOLOv8 using this preprocessed dataset
- Track mAP, precision, and recall per class
- Deploy model with Streamlit interface
- Evaluate real-time performance on GPU/edge device
